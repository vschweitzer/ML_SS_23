Several good results suggest 5 neighbors to be ideal. While the most highly rated combination of hyperparameters includes \texttt{mutual_info_classif} as a scoring function, the next few combinations use \texttt{chi2} instead. Using more features, it seems that these slightly lower rated combinations are more consistent between folds, even though the top rated combination scores better on average.
